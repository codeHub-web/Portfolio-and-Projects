        <p>Anticipate questions like "Tell me about yourself" or "What are your strengths and weaknesses?" and have clear, concise answers.</p>
        <p>Tell me about a time when you had to work with a difficult colleague?</p>
        <p>Give me an example of a time you had to prioritize multiple tasks. How did you manage your time?</p><br>

        <strong>2. Do Your Research:</strong>
        <p>Learn about the company’s culture, values, and products. Understanding the company will help you answer questions more effectively.</p>
        <p>Learning about your potential employer not only shows your interest in the company and your attention to detail, but helps innderstanding a company's culture not only helps you assess whether it’s a good fit for you but also prepares you to succeed in the role and build a meaningful, long-term career</p><br>
